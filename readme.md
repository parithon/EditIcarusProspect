# Icarus Prospect Editor

A command line program that modifies properties of an Icarus prospect save.

## Features

This program allows you to set new values for various properties of an Icarus prospect save as well as allowing you to rename the prospect. See the "How to use" section for a complete list of features and how to use them.

## Releases

Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/CrystalFerrai/EditIcarusProspect/releases). There is no installer, just unzip the contents to a location on your hard drive.

You will need to have the .NET Runtime 8.0 x64 installed. You can find the latest .NET 8 downloads [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). Look for ".NET Runtime" or ".NET Desktop Runtime" (which includes .NET Runtime). Download and install the x64 version for your OS.

**Prior to release version 1.3**, You will need to have the .NET Runtime 7.0 x64 installed (instead of .NET 8.0). You can find the latest .NET 7 downloads [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0). Look for ".NET Runtime" or ".NET Desktop Runtime" (which includes .NET Runtime). Download and install the x64 version for your OS.

## How to Use

**BACKUP YOUR SAVE FILE BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM.** If something goes wrong, there is no way to recover your save unless you have a backup.

### Prerequisite
You can now run the program without any parameters to use the interactive menu. Command line parameters are still supported for scripting and automation.

### Step 1: Locate your prospect save file
The normal location for these files is:
```
%localappdata%\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\[your steam id]\Prospects
```

If you are running a dedicated server, the save file location will be different and may vary depending where your server is hosted. You will need to download the save file if it is hosted remotely, modify it, then reupload it. If your server is self hosted, the location for save files should be inside your server install directory at:
```
Icarus/Saved/PlayerData/DedicatedServer/Prospects
```

### Step 2: Backup your save files
Make copies of your prospect save files, ideally in some other location so that your game doesn't show duplicate saves.

### Step 3: Circumvent Steam Cloud
_This applies to local save files. If you are modifying a dedicated server save file, you can skip this step._

When you modify a save file, Steam cloud will often end up undoing your changes next time you run the game as it will download the copy from the cloud. There are two ways to circumvent this issue. You can either disable Steam cloud for Icarus from the Steam library or you can have the game running and sitting at the main menu while you modify the save files.

### Step 4: Run EditIcarusProspect
_Make sure the prospect is not currently loaded in your game or dedicated server before doing this step._

Open a command prompt (cmd) wherever you downloaded EditIcarusProspect and either:

- run `EditIcarusProspect` with no parameters to launch the interactive menu, or
- run a command like the following to use the original scripted command line workflow.

Substitute your save file location and file name.
```
EditIcarusProspect -p friends %localappdata%\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\[your steam id]\Prospects\[your prospect file name].json
```

The above command updates the prospect to allow friends to join. You can add any of the following commands to the command line depending what you want to change.
```
-s, -stats                Print statistics about the contents of the prospect save.

-n, -name [value]         Set the prospect name to the supplied value.
						  Note: This will also change the file name.

-p, -privacy [option]     Set the lobby privacy for the prospect to one of the following.
						  friends    Steam friends can join.
						  private    No one can join.

-d, -difficulty [option]  Set the game difficulty for the prospect to one of [easy, medium, hard, extreme].
						  Warning: Extreme difficulty is only implemented for outposts. Things will break if
						  you use it elsewhere.

-h, -hardcore [on/off]    Turn on or off the ability to self-respawn if you die in the prospect.

-z, -dropzone [index]     Set the selected drop zone for the prospect.
						  Warning: Ensure the chosen index is valid for the specific map.

-m, -mission [params]     Commands to manipulate mission history - intended only for open world prospects.

						  list           List recorded missions.

						  remove [list]  Remove specific missions from the record. Pass in a comma-separated
										 list of mission indeces to remove. No spaces.
										 Example: remove 0,4,17

						  clear          Remove all missions from the record.

						  Warning: Removing a currently active mission may cause problems.

-b, -prebuilt [params]    Commands to manipulate mission generated prebuilt structures.

						  list           List prebuilt structures.

						  details        List prebuilt structures including details about their contents.

						  remove [list]  Remove specific structures. Pass in a comma-separated list of
										 structure indeces to remove. No spaces.
										 Example: remove 1,3,4

						  clear          Remove all prebuilt structures.

						  Warning: Removing a prebuilt structure associated with a currently active mission
								   may cause problems.

-l, -list                 Prints information about all player characters stored in the prospect.

-c, -cleanup              Removes any rockets or other player data that is not associated with a valid player.
						  Run this if you see any warnings when running -list that you want to clean up.

-r, -remove [players]     Removes listed player characters and their rockets. List a player's Steam ID to
						  remove all of that player's characters. To remove only a specific character, list
						  a Steam ID followed by a hyphen, followed by the character slot number. Separate
						  list entries with commas. Do not include any spaces.

						  Example: -r 76561100000000000,76561150505050505-0,76561123232323232

						  Warning: Players removed this way will not be able to reclaim their loadout unless
						  it is insured.
```

NOTE: Renaming a prospect causes the game to treat it as a separate prospect. This means any characters on the prospect with workshop loadouts will still be referencing the old prospect name and will not be able to send or receive workshop items in the renamed prospect. Players can edit their Loadouts.json to point to the new prospect to resolve this, or they can exit (fly out of) the prospect before the rename and rejoin after.

3. Right click the solution in the Solution Explorer panel and select "Restore NuGet Dependencies".
4. Build the solution.

## Disclaimer

This program worked for me when I created it, but I only did limited testing. It may cause unintended side effects in your save, so back it up first and then verify no issues in game. This program may stop working if the prospect save format is updated in the future. Feel free to open an issue ticket on the Github repo to let me know if this happens.

## Support

This is just one of my many free time projects. No support or documentation is offered beyond this readme.
